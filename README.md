# EatSmart
This an Api health application using node.js and express. This application is for a hackathon in the Road to Hire apprenticeship that we designed for healthy eating. This web application is responsive for both mobile and desktop. The goal of the app is to help people who want a delicious, quick, and healthy meal. The user can search for any recipe they want in the recipe search bar in the recipe page or the search bar in the top right of the navbar and it will pull up recipe from a third party api that we used called https://www.edamam.com/ We know that unhealthy eating is a major problem around the world so we wanted to create a simple web application that could help solve this problem with just a simple search in our application.
